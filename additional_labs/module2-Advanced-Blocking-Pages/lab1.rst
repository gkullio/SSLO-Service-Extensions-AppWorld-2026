Addtional Lab 2: Advanced Blocking Pages Scenario
================================

|

Challenge
---------

Your company currently has a solution for blocking users from accessing inappropriate content on the internet. However, the solution is not branded to your company and does not provide a good user experience. You are challenged with finding a solution to improve the user experience and provide a branded static or dynamic blocking page to the user.

Solution
--------

The **F5 SSL Orchestrator Service Extension** for **Advanced Blocking Pages** can help meet this challenge. When a user attempts to connect to a website, the **advanced blocking pages** inspection would be applied to the traffic flow. This action will provide either a static or dynamic blocking page to the user based on the configuration of the service extension iRule.
