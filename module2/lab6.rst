Trigger Conditions for User Coaching with JA4 Persistence Method
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The presentation of the user coaching prompt is determined by a URL category match. The category list is defined in the **user-coaching-rule** iRule.

#. Navigate to **Local Traffic > iRules** and verify that the following iRules are present.

#. Click on the **user-coaching-rule** iRule to view it.

#. Notice that the **IDENTIFIER_TYPE** defines the variable for persistence.  In this case, ``ja4`` commented out and will need to be uncommented to use the JA4 persistence method.

#. Ensure the user-coaching-rule iRule is updated to use the JA4 persistence method and looks like the following:  

   .. figure:: images/uc-ja4-enable.png

      Commented out the default cookie persistence method and uncommented the JA4 persistence method.


#. Click on the **Update** button to save the changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      :align: left


#. Click on the **Agree** button to acknowledge the warning and terms of use policy. You will then be presented with the OpenAI ChatGPT site.

#. Restart **Firefox** and browse to ChatGPT again. You should not see the prompt reappear because the original user coaching acknowledgement has not expired yet.

   .. note::

      The default user coaching session timeout setting is 3600 seconds. This value is configurable in the **user-coaching-rule** iRule under the ``SESSION_TIMER`` section.  ``set static::JA4_SESSION_TIMER 3600``
