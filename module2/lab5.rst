Implement User Coaching with Default Cookie Persistence Method
==============================================================================

You will now enable and test the **user coaching** functionality. This will produce a prompt in the web browser when a user attempts to connect to a *risky AI* web site.


Add User Coaching Inspection Service to a Service Chain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a new Service Chain that contains the user coaching service (ssloS_F5_UC).


#. Click on the **Service Chains** tab.

   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-5.png
      :align: left


#. From the **Service Chain List**, click on the **Add** button.

#. Enter ``user_coaching`` in the **Name** field.

#. Double-click on the **ssloS_F5_UC** Service to add it to the Service Chain. 

   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-6.png
      :align: left


#. Click on the **Deploy** button.

#. When the deployment has completed, click on the **OK** button to close the dialog box and return to the **Topologies** list.

#. Click on the **Service Chains** tab to confirm that the new **Service Chain** was created.

Update the Security Policy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The final step is to update the **Security Policy** to use the new **Service Chain**.

#. Click on the **Security Policies** tab to view the list of policies.

#. Click on the **ssloP_l3_outbound** policy to edit it.

   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-8.png
      :align: left

#. Click on the **Edit** (pencil) icon for the **All Traffic** rule.


   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-9.png
      :align: left


#. Set **SSL Proxy Action** to **Intercept**.

#. Set **Service Chain** to **ssloSC_user_coaching**.

   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-10.png
      :align: left

#. Click on the **OK** button to exit edit mode.

   Your **Security Policy** should now look like the following:

   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-11.png
      :align: left


#. Click on the **Deploy** button and then click on **Deploy** again to accept the warning.

   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-12.png
      :align: left

#. When the deployment has completed, click on the **OK** button to close the dialog box and return to the **Topologies** list.

Trigger Conditions for User Coaching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The presentation of the user coaching prompt is determined by a URL category match. The category list is defined in the **user-coaching-rule** iRule.

#. Navigate to **Local Traffic > iRules** and verify that the following iRules are present.

#. Click on the **user-coaching-rule** iRule to view and modify it.

#. Notice that the **COOKIE_IDENT** section variables define the cookie persistence settings. By default, the cookie value is not encrypted.

      Unencrypted Cookie Value Settings

#. Alternatively, you can encrypt the cookie value with an AES value of your choice. In this example, remove the comment from the ``set static::COOKIE_KEY "AES 128 b55c4753cba6adaa0e4ea7640504d9b4"`` and add a comment to the ``set static::COOKIE_KEY ""`` line.

   .. figure:: images/uc-cookie-key-2.png

      Encrypted Cookie Value Settings

#. Whichever method you decide to use, *encrypted* or *unencrypted*, ensure you click on the **Update** button to save any changes.



Test User Coaching
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Return to the **Ubuntu-Client** WEBRDP session.

#. Close the **Firefox** browser window and restart the application.

#. Navigate to https://chatgpt.com/. You should receive the SSL Orchestrator user coaching prompt as follows:

   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-13.png
      :align: left


#. Click on the **Agree** button to acknowledge the warning and terms of use policy. You will then be presented with the OpenAI ChatGPT site.

   .. image:: ./images/user-coaching-14.png
      :align: left

#. Restart **Firefox** and browse to ChatGPT again. You will be prompted again because this persistence method is based on cookies and the original user coaching acknowledgement has expired.

   .. note::

      Since this persistence method is based on cookies, the user will be prompted again when the user closes and restarts the browser.  

#. If the desire is to have the user only be prompted once per assigned time period, then the JA4 persistence method should be used instead.  See **Optional** Lab 6 for more information and steps to accomplish.
