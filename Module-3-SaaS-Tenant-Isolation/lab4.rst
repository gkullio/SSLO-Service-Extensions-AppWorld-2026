In this lab module, you completed the following tasks:

- Reviewed the behavior of the **SaaS Tenant Isolation** iRule and how it operates against different SaaS Applications.

- Used the existing **L3 Outbound** (transparent forward proxy) topology and deployed a new **service extension** for **SaaS Tenant Isolation** to control which SaaS application tenants your users can access.
