=================

Well done! You have successfully implented controls to inspect and block DNS-over-HTTPS requests.  

In this lab, you completed the following tasks:

-  Used the DoH Guardian Service to initially inspect and apply controls to blackhole requests that match against specific URL categories.

-  Implemented a method to sinkhole requests and utilize a blocking page to display to a user, when and why a request was blocked.

-  Used the existing **L3 Outbound Proxy** and stacked the DoH Guardian Service to the existing Service Chain.

This is the end of this lab module.
