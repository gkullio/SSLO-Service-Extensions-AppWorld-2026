Lab 3: Automation with Ansible
================================================================================

In the previous module, you manually created and deployed two **Outbound Layer 3 Topologies** with the following:

- SSL configurations

- Outbound Layer 3 Services (User Coaching and DNS-over-HTTPS Guardian)

- Service Chains
