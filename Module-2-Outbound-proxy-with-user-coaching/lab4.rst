Route Client Traffic via BIG-IP SSL Orchestrator
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to route outbound traffic through the BIG-IP SSL Orchestrator, you will need to confirm the default gateway on the **Ubuntu-Client** machine.

#. From the **Deployment** tab, click on the **Access** dropdown on the  **Ubuntu-Client** resource, and select the **WEBRDP** option.

#. This will open a new tab in your browser.  You will be prompted for username and password for **Apache Guacamole**.  Enter the following credentials:

   - **Username**: ``user``
   - **Password**: ``user``

#. Click on the **Terminal** icon at the bottom of the screen to open a new Terminal shell session.

#. Confirm the default gateway is set to the BIG-IP SSL Orchestrator. ``10.1.10.7``

Test Internet Access
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. Close the **Firefox** browser window and restart the application.

#. Navigate to https://www.f5.com.

   .. Important::

      Do not continue if you cannot browse the Internet from the Ubuntu-Client machine. If you are not able to resolve this on your own, reach out to the lab instructor/assistants to help troubleshoot.

#. Hover the mouse pointer over the padlock icon on the address bar and verify that it displays **Verified by: f5labs.com**. This confirms that SSL Orchestrator is performing TLS interception (decrypt & inspect) for outbound traffic. The TLS certificate for https://www.f5.com was forged by the subrsa CA certificate, which is trusted by the client machine.

#. Now, test a generative AI web site. Navigate to https://chatgpt.com and verify that it is accessible without any restrictions.

   .. note::

      You will test this again after enabling the **user coaching** functionality.

This completes the basic L3 Outbound Topology configuration.
